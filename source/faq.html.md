# What is a microservice ?

A microservice typically refers to a small piece of software, that only perform
one or a few tasks, hopefully well.

Complex applications can be then built by combining multiple microservices. This
way of structuring applications should promote flexibilty and reusability of code.


# Why do I need microservices ?

Maybe you do, maybe you don't. Microservices are not a silver bullet to all the
problems of the world of software developement.

However the general concept make sense

# Where I can learn more about microservices ?

Here are the wikipedia pages on [Microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices)
and [Service-oriented architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture).

The following two websites also present good explanations of the whole affair :
[martinfowler.com](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html),
[microservices.io](http://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html)

Here are some books about the subject :

* [Production-Ready Microservices](https://www.amazon.com/Production-Ready-Microservices-Standardized-Engineering-Organization/dp/1491965975/)

# What is a container ?

# What is Docker ?

# What is REST ?

# What is the MSA ?

The Microservices Agency (MSA) is


# Why did you create the MSA ?

I often see really interesting code, but it's using a different language or framework
than the project I'm currently working on, and integration can be a pain.

Sometimes I look back at old projects of mine, and find it hard to get them
working again, either because my computer is configured in a different fashion
and/or I forgot to document a step.

This project is a humble attempt to fix those problems.

# MSA Objectives

- Lower the barrier to entry

  - by providing a quick guide and examples on how to use it

  - by packaging it in a format that can be deployed in less than 5 minutes

- Promote reusability

  - by exposing the functionality over standardized APIs easy to integrate

  - by writing simple software, that do one or very few things, hopefully well

- Provide good enough performance

  - by leveraging techniques such as caching data when it makes sense

  - by making it possible to throw more servers at the problem, if needed


# Can I submit a microservice to the MSA ?

Absolutely ! Check out the [Contribute](/contribute) page to know how.

# Where can I find templates to create my own microservices ?

All our source code can be found on the following Github page.

# Why the emphasis on creative applications ?

Simply because I see a lot of very interesting code
