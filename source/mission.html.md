# The problem

I often see really interesting code, but it's using a different language or framework
 than the project I'm currently working on, and integration can be a pain.

Sometimes I look back at old projects of mine, and find it hard to get them
 working again, either because my computer is configured in a different fashion
 and/or I forgot to document a step.

This project is a humble attempt to fix those problems.

# The proposed solution

is mostly a [set of conventions](/standard), and a [bit of technology](/templates).

# Objectives

- Lower the barrier to entry

  - by providing a quick guide and examples on how to use it

  - by packaging it in a format that can be deployed in less than 5 minutes

- Promote reusability

  - by exposing the functionality over standardized APIs easy to integrate

  - by writing simple software, that do one or very few things, hopefully well

- Provide good enough performance

  - by leveraging techniques such as caching data when it makes sense

  - by making it possible to throw more servers at the problem, if needed
